# üéµ Data Structure Mini Project: Spotify-Like Algorithm-Based Music Player

This project implements a music player using linked lists to manage a playlist, inspired by Spotify-like functionalities. It allows users to add, play, delete, and shuffle songs in a dynamic playlist while leveraging system commands to play .mp3 files using the default media player.

üìã Features  
1. Add Songs: Add new .mp3 songs to the playlist and save them to a file (songs.txt).  
2. Play Songs: Play selected songs or navigate through the playlist using:  
&nbsp;- Play Next  
&nbsp;- Play Previous  
&nbsp;- Play Selected Song  
3. Shuffle Play: Randomly select and play a song from the playlist.  
4. Delete Songs: Delete songs from the playlist.  
5. Display Playlist: View the current playlist.  
6. Persistent Storage: Songs are stored in songs.txt and loaded on startup.

üõ†Ô∏è Data Structures Used  

&nbsp;- Doubly Linked List: Manages the dynamic playlist, allowing forward and backward navigation.  
&nbsp;- File Handling: Loads and saves songs to songs.txt for persistent storage.

üìù Project Structure

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prototype.c    # Main source code file  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ songs.txt         # File storing the playlist (full paths of .mp3 files)  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # Project documentation  

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

Ensure your .mp3 file paths are correct.  
For Windows, paths should use double backslashes (\\) or forward slashes (/).  
The program uses the system's default media player to play songs.
